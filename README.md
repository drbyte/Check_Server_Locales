# Check Server Locales (for Zen Cart)
Parses arrays of possible locale names, to check which are installed on a server (Windows/Unix) and so confirm what you may use for LC_TIME in the two main Zen Cart language files.

It does not need Zen Cart to execute, but I think the best location for this file is /extras.

Instructions are in the script.
